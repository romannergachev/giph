This is a small appilcation showing list of images and as a detailed information play GIF on the screen.
I've used MVVM approach with android data binding as my core architecture. The other option was to use a little bit more

I've used Retrofit for API calls, Rx with Reltrolambda, Picasso for image loading, Glide for GIFs and Junit with Mockito for Unit testing.
